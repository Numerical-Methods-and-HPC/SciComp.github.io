# Learn Scientific Computing

This is a repo for sharing ideas/codes/demo's related to Numerical Methods used in CFD, FEA, DL, ML and/or its HPC aspects, with a purpose of academic, professional or lesiure satisfaction. Be organized !!!

## Guidelines for contributors
- For those interested in contributing to the demonstrations, please contribute your ideas [here](https://github.com/Numerical-Methods-and-HPC/LearnSciComp/discussions) in Julia/MATLAB like readable pseudocode syntax. For HPC related stuff, you can digress later into other languages if needed.
- Request to review your contributions from other contributors
- Get familiar with github first or keep a github [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images) ready with you. It should help you in effectively expressing yourself in `Issues` or `PRs` or `Discussions`
- Currently, to view some markdown files in some docs uploaded a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-math-display/cgolaobglebjonjiblcjagnpmdmlgmda) is needed. Will try to remove this dependency soon.
## Trends in Numerical Methods used in CFD/ FEA/ ML and DL these days
Lets start with 
### 1.) Differentiation
A lot depends on how we approximate differential operators or calculate gradients in these numerical methods. To put it succinctly, there are challenges to approximate these differential operators properly, and its a useful skill for a computational science student. If one keeps up with major ways of approximating differential operators are by following way, 
- **Automatic differentiation** (a numerical approach used in automatic differentiation libraries like Tensorflow/PyTorch/Zygote. An ongoing discussion is [here](https://github.com/Numerical-Methods-and-HPC/LearnSciComp/discussions/1)) 
- **Traditional Numerical differentiation** (good old Taylor series, majorly used in CFD softwares) We have been exposed to traditional numerical differentiation a lot times, but a bulk of us don't know how to create automatically stencils and Differential operators matrices and applying boundary conditions on them. </br>
On going discussion of creating general *finite difference stencils*, [here](https://github.com/Numerical-Methods-and-HPC/LearnSciComp/discussions/3).</br>
On going discussion of creating general *spectral differentiation operators*, [here](https://github.com/Numerical-Methods-and-HPC/LearnSciComp/discussions/5)
- **Symbolic differentiation** (used in Maple/Mathematica/Sage like Libraries) 

In coming weeks, a small demonstration/blog of these would be added, along with useful references
